🌊 **Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trends of Non-Indigenous Species in the Basque Coast and Estuaries**

Welcome to the repository for my Master’s Thesis on the Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trends of Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) in the Basque Coast and Estuaries. This research investigates the presence, patterns, and potential impacts of non-indigenous species in this unique and biodiverse marine environment, with the goal of informing effective conservation and management strategies.

**📚 Overview**
Non-indigenous species pose a major threat to marine ecosystems by disrupting native biodiversity and altering ecological balance. This project examines spatial and temporal trends of NIS in the Basque coast and estuarine regions, focusing on:

Patterns of distribution: Mapping species presence across coastal and estuarine zones to identify hotspots and emerging areas of concern.

Temporal trends: Analyzing data over time to understand trends in species proliferation, seasonal variations, and long-term changes.

Environmental impact: Assessing potential ecological impacts of NIS on local biodiversity and habitat structure.

**📍Key Components**
1. Data Collection and Processing
Field Surveys and Historical Records: Data sources include direct surveys, species monitoring records, and historical data from environmental agencies.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Scripts for handling inconsistencies, filling in missing values, and preparing data for spatial analysis.
2. Spatial Analysis
Mapping NIS Distribution: Using GIS and spatial analysis tools to map current NIS distribution patterns and identify high-risk areas.
Hotspot Analysis: Applying spatial statistics to detect clusters of NIS presence and areas of significant spread.
Environmental Correlations: Investigating relationships between NIS distribution and environmental factors (e.g., water temperature, salinity).
3. Temporal Analysis
Trend Analysis: Examining long-term data to identify trends in NIS abundance and spread over time.
Predictive Modeling: Using time series models to project future trends and assess potential risk factors.

**📊 Tools and Methodologies**
GIS and Mapping: Tools like QGIS for spatial visualization and analysis.
R Scripts: Code for data processing, statistical analysis, and trend modeling.
Species Distribution Models (SDMs): Applying SDMs to predict potential spread and identify favorable habitats for NIS under various environmental conditions.

**🔍 Research Value**
This project aims to contribute valuable insights into marine ecology, conservation efforts, and environmental management in the Basque coast region. 
By understanding the spatial and temporal trends of NIS, we can better inform policy decisions, early detection measures, and control strategies to mitigate the impact of invasive species.
